<h1>Salesforce Nurse Unit Management App Project</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
While consulting, I was tasked to create an app that would solve a business issue for our clients. To help aid Jackson nursing staff in perfecting and tracking nursing workloads, I built a Salesforce custom app to track nurse staff and their patient and task workloads. This app will assist nurse managers with viewing and collecting data on staff daily workloads, as well as provide historical data on the productivity of staff and a nurse unit as a whole over time. This will help provide information to make staffing decisions, patient population assessments, and more.
